# My Discord Bots
A couple of generic Discord bots coded in Python

## General Bot

The 'General Bot' functions as a middle-man between Discord and the server, running pre-set server commands when a certain message is sent. For example, the storage status and temperature of the server have custom commands.

## Croc Bot

Croc (Schollz.croc) is a file transfer program that utilises open relays, similar to that of Wormhole. This Discord bot automates the process, by finding a file the user requests and then processing a code for transfer.
